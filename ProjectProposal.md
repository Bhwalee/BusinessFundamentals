# Proposal 

I would like to analyze given rising oil price, transitioning to eletric vehicles are crucial to decrease fossil fuel and adopt clean energy. As demand for electric vehicle is surging, there needs to be more charging stations with better locations. 

Determine which states have faster rate of adapting eletrical vehicle and based on the location, what location would be optimal to put charging station to increase revenue. 

Given precise location, charging station will depend on a number of factors - rent price, workforce, demographics...etc

Installing charging stations will boost more electrical vehicle demand and thus increase more jobs and revenue. Prevalence of charging stations will help those who have ev, but those who don't will have to pay for higher oil price.
