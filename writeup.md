Abstract – For this project, I wanted to explore between internet users’ rate and broadband accessibility. Due to increasing internet users’ rate, broadbands are needed to insure internet traffic and stable connections. However, many factors affect cities and counties to have limited access to internet. Especially based on different urbanization rate, some counties have less internet connections. More broadbands should be installed to ensure equality and reduce digital divide

Design – Given many factors that affect different urbanization, I tried to show how each counties have different access to the internet by comparing internet user’s rate. New opportunities to capture market size and encourage economic and technological development

Data – Acquired data based on broadband subscription rate based on counties. Total internet users’ rate and broadband subscription rate.  

Algorithms – For this project, I explored different counties and what causes them to have limited access to the internet. Using tableau and excel, I created VLOOKUP using indexes to refer countries’ internet users’ rate and broadband accessibility. Compared between different counties in Texas to show limited access. 

Communications –  Used Tableau and Excel to analyze and visualize the data. Used PowerPoint to give presentation to the class.
