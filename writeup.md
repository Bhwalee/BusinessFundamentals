Abstract – For this project, I want to explore the relationship between the internet users’ rate and broadband accessibility. Due to the increasing internet users’ rate, broadbands are needed to ensure the internet traffic and provide stable connections. Many cities and counties have limited access to the internet. Based on different urbanization rate, some counties have lesser internet connections. More broadbands should be installed to ensure equality and reduce digital divide.

Design – Given many factors that affect urbanization rate, I wanted to highlight how each counties have different access to the internet by comparing internet user’s rate. New opportunities to capture market size and encourage economic and technological development.

Data – acquired from broadband subscription rate based on different counties. Total internet users’ rate and broadband subscription rate.  

Algorithms – I explored different counties and what causes them to have limited access to the internet. Using tableau and excel, I created VLOOKUP using indexes to refer countries’ internet users’ rate and its broadband accessibility. Comparison between different counties in Texas to show the limited access of the Internet.

Communications –  Used Tableau and Excel to analyze and visualize the data. Used PowerPoint to give presentation to the class.
