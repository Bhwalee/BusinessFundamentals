# BusinessFundamentals

Summary
Say that you'd like to do some data work for an organization, but they aren't hiring. They might not even know that they could benefit from the data science services of a skilled practitioner like you. How can you get their attention?

For this project, you are going to deliver a well-scoped project proposal and preliminary analysis to your target organization (“client”) to try to get your foot in the door. Your job is to:

Define a realistic business problem faced by your client
Develop a fully-scoped proposal for how data science methods can be used to drive impact towards the defined problem, making use of the project identification and scoping best practices covered in lecture. At the very least, components should include:
Impact hypothesis
Solution paths
Measures of success, both technical and non-technical
Risks and assumptions
Identify one or more publicly-accessible datasets relevant to your proposal and perform a preliminary analysis of the data, e.g. descriptive / exploratory analysis and visualizations. This analysis should explain the nature of your data and provide evidence that your proposed data science project is a feasible solution to the problem.
Clearly outline the future data science steps that were not covered in your preliminary analysis
Communicate your proposal and preliminary findings in a 5 minute mock "pitch" presentation at the end of week 2 and in a short written description (more details below)
