The goal of this project is to better understand how internet usage is increasing over time. I examined by comparing the number of broadband installed across the United States and analyzed number of internet users between 1990 - 2016 to predict future number of internet users. 

I will be using linear regression model and time-series model to predict why more broadbands should be installed given increasing number of internet / mobile cellular users annually.

Few graphs show that broadband is not increasing fast enough to catch the number of internet users. To meet the demand of high-internet speed, more broadband should be installed as we become more interconnected to the internet.
